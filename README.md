# Profit First Allocations Calculator

## Overview

The **Profit First Allocations Calculator** is a financial tool based on the "Profit First" methodology. It allows individuals and businesses to divide their income into distinct categories such as profit, ownerâ€™s pay, taxes, and operating expenses. This approach helps prioritize profit, ensuring that it's not an afterthought but rather the cornerstone of the financial strategy.

The calculator takes in:
- Total Income
- Percentage allocation for Profit, Owner's Pay, and Taxes

It then provides a breakdown of the dollar amounts allocated to each category. The remaining income is automatically allocated for operating expenses.

This tool is ideal for:
- **Entrepreneurs**
- **Small Business Owners**
- **Freelancers**
- **Individuals looking to manage personal finances more efficiently**

By visualizing how their revenue is distributed, users can ensure they are allocating the proper portions of their income to the right categories while adhering to the Profit First philosophy.

## Features
- Input fields for total income and percentage allocation to Profit, Owner Pay, and Tax.
- Automatically calculates and displays allocated amounts for each category.
- Validates that the sum of Profit, Owner Pay, and Tax percentages does not exceed 100%.
- Real-time updates to allocations as values are inputted.
- Prevents calculations when combined percentages exceed 100%, displaying a helpful alert message.

## Use Case

The Profit First Allocations Calculator is built to help users adhere to the **Profit First** financial management strategy developed by Mike Michalowicz. The concept of Profit First is to prioritize profit from the start instead of treating it as the leftover result after all expenses are covered. By making consistent allocations from revenue, businesses can improve profitability and maintain healthy cash flows.

This calculator simplifies that process by providing a quick, real-time breakdown of how revenue should be split across Profit, Owner Pay, Taxes, and Operating Expenses. Entrepreneurs, small business owners, and individuals can use this tool to enforce better budgeting practices, making sure profit is a consistent focus in their financial planning.
